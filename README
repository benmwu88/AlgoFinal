Welcome to the Git Repository for our final project!

This program will simulate a game in which players can either win or lose.
When the game ends, each player's statistics will be updated on a leaderboard.
The leaderboard will be actively changing based on whose win record is best.

To run the program, download the main.cpp file
Once you have the file, ensure you have MinGW installed on your machine
From the terminal, navigate to the folder in which the file is kept and run it using g++.
Observe the leaderboard update as you instruct it to simulate more games.
